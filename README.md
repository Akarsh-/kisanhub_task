# kisanhub_task
This is 3 question task for kisan hub interview round

I have done backend using python-django. The front end is done using HTML, CSS, JS, ChartJs and bootstrap.

This was my first experience with python-django. I learnt and applied it for first time. 
(Obviously there could be better ways of doing it)

Also, I have used chartjs for first time.

The whole project was fun overall.

To start project
1)install app "helloworld" (sorry for this name)
2)Make an entry in Main urls
3)make migrations
4)launch


Thanks
