# kisanhub_task
This is 3 question task for kisan hub interview round

I have done backend using python-django. The front end is done using HTML, CSS, JS, ChartJs and bootstrap.

This was my first experience with python-django. I learnt and applied it for first time. 
(Obviously there could be better ways of doing it)

Also, I have used chartjs for first time.

The whole project was fun overall.

To start project just install app "helloworld" (sorry for this name)

Thanks
